ReasoningNode

A base class for agent reasoning using the template method pattern.

- Handles conversation history and tool calls.
- Defines a standard flow for generating agent responses.
- Subclasses implement `_process_context()` to provide custom reasoning.

This class simplifies building agents that need both conversation management and tool integration.

        Flow:
            1. Check for conversation messages
            2. Build conversation context. To override, implement :method:`_build_conversation_context`

        - ToolResult: Record that the tool call was executed and the result.
          - Does not necessarily correspond to a previous ToolCall if the user decided not to yield one.
          - This is common for tool calls that are sync or run very quickly.
